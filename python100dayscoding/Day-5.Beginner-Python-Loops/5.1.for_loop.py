'''
For loop prints each item in the list one after the other
'''

# fruits = [ "Apple", "Peach", "Pear", "Mango"]
# for i in fruits:
#     print(i)
#     print(i + " Pie")
# print(fruits) # see the results. its good to look at indentations

Exercise 1 - Average Height

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.


'''
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

'''
Easy way

total_height = sum(student_heights)
number_of_students = len(student_height)
average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(average_height)
'''

'''

total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
#print(total_height)

number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
    number_of_students += 1
#print(number_of_students)

average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(average_height)

Exercise 2 - High Score
Instructions
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
The highest score in the class is: x
'''

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
#   student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
# #print(student_scores)
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#
# #Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
heighest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > heighest_score:
        heighest_score = score
print(f" The heighest score in the class is: {heighest_score}")
