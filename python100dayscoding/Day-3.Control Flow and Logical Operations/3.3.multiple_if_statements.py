Logic to know


********if/elif/else**********
if condition1:
    do A
elif condition2:
    do B
else:
    do C
Here once one condition is satisfied the code stops

**** multiple if************
if condition1:
    do A
if condition2:
    do B
if condition3:
    do C
Here all the conditions are checked

We are going to use the Rollercoaster example
'''

# print("Welcome to the  Rollercoaster!")
# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
# bill = 0
# if height >= 120:
#     print("You can ride the Rollercoaster!")
#     age = int(input("What is your age? "))
#     if age < 12:
#         bill = 5
#         print("Child tickets are $5.")
#     elif age <= 18:
#         bill = 7
#         print("Youth tickets are $7.")
#     elif age <= 65:
#         bill = 12
#         print("Adult tickets are $12.")
#     else:
#         bill = 3
#         print("Grandparent tickets are $3.")
#     wants_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. ")
#     if wants_photo == "Y":
#         bill += 3
#     print(f"Your final bill is ${bill}")
